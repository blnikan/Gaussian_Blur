There are many algorithms to implement blur, one of them is called Gaussian Blur Algorithm. 
It utilizes Gaussian distribution to process images.


GaussianBlur - gaussian blur of the entire photo with a choice of sigma and blur radius

gb_circleZone - the radius of the circle is set, after which a Gaussian gradient blur is applied to the rest of the photo (the farther from the selected circular area, the greater the blur radius and the more the photo is blurred)
